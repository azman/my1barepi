This is a program that allows the gpio pins to be controlled using HC06
bluetooth module. It also gathers some information using mailbox interface
to the VideoCore GPU.

Note:
- command: info <board|video>
  = information related to board or graphics
- command: gpio <num> <config|set|clr|read>
  = control (and get status of) gpio pins
  = sub-command: gpio <num> config <in|out>

*Task* Reduce code
- simplify the code so that only gpio commands are available

*Task* Adding more command(s)
- modify the code to have another command for i/o toggle
