This is a program that produces a squarewave signal with microsecond precision.

*Task* Create another square-wave signal on another GPIO
- with the same frequency and phase
- with the same frequency at 180 degrees phase shift
- with half frequency but same phase
- with half frequency at 180 degrees phase shift

*Task* Add code to have a button control/switch signal ON/OFF

*Task* Add code to have buttons to control pulse width
